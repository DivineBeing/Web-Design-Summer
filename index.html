            <p>Sukuta is my alter ego of sorts. My artist and stage name is Sukuta, it is something I came up with around 2018. Sukuta is a true visionary in music and fashion, effortlessly blending these two worlds to create something truly unique. As a professional music engineer and artist, Sukuta's work is nothing short of amazing. He has produced tons of different musical elements, showcasing his talent across a variety of genres and styles. Every piece of music he creates shows his innovative approach and deep understanding of sound engineering, capturing the essence of modern music while pushing its boundaries. Sukuta's talents don't stop at music. He's also made a big impact in the fashion industry. He has designed and produced numerous clothing items that reflect his distinctive style and artistic vision. Every item is crafted with incredible attention to detail, making sure it stands out in the crowded fashion world. Sukuta's entrepreneurial spirit led him to start Divine Records, a record label that embodies his commitment to quality and innovation. Divine Records has become a haven for artists who share his passion for pushing creative boundaries and making music that really resonates with people. The label is known for its diverse talent and its dedication to helping artists grow their careers, providing them with the support and resources they need to succeed in the music industry.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In this class, I am learning various web development skills, including how to write well-formed HTML5 code. This involves using semantic tags like <strong>header</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong> to structure the content properly.</p>
            <p>Some of the techniques we are focusing on include ensuring our code is <em>standards-compliant</em> and validating it using the W3C Validator. This helps in creating websites that are accessible and functional across different browsers and devices.</p>
            <p>Right now, I feel most of this is hard but by the end of this course, I aim to build a fully functional website that showcases my skills and the knowledge I have gained throughout the course.</p>

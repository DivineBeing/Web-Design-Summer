    <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
    <p>In this class, I am learning various web development skills, including how to write well-formed HTML5 code. This
        involves using semantic tags like <strong>header</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong> to
        structure the content properly.</p>
    <p>Some of the techniques we are focusing on include ensuring our code is <em>standards-compliant</em> and
        validating it using the W3C Validator. This helps in creating websites that are accessible and functional across
        different browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>Right now, I feel most of this is hard but by the end of this course, I aim to build a fully functional website
        that showcases my skills and the knowledge I have gained throughout the course.</p>
